\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is the repository for Shepard\'92s advanced programming class at the downtown community center for the 2017 winter/spring session\
\
The way it works is that each folder in this repository will be a different topic we covered, with some text explaining the concept as well as the code that we did. The code will be commented with what certain bits of it do, as well as suggestions for how to edit and alter, or even improve it.\
\
I might add little coding challenges that you can complete on your own, for fun and added learning.\
\
Thanks for reading, and take care~\
